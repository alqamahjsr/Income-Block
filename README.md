# Income-Block
A Free Ether Sharing and Interest Dividend Earning Platform


### Setup
To run this project, node and npm must be installed. With npm, you must install ganache-cli to run a local development blockchain. Truffle is also needed to distribute the smart contracts to the blockchain. You can do this by executing the following commands:
```
npm install -g ganache-cli
npm install -g truffle
```
### Run a local blockchain
Once ganache-cli is installed, type this command into your console to start the local blockchain:
```
ganache-cli
```
Add the mnemonics generated by ganache to your MetaMask, by following this tutorial https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/truffle-with-metamask.


```
Go to the client directory:
```
cd client
```

Note: In the repo you would also get the node modules, if they are for any reason not in the client directory or you prefer to install them seperately, feel free to add the following commands to your console:
```
npm install
npm install @rimble/connection-banner
npm install --save rimble-ui styled-components
npm install openzeppelin-solidity
npm install web3 (latest version)
npm install --save bindings
npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
```

Now, you need to compile and migrate the smart contracts with truffle. Note that it is necessary that ganache-cli runs in a separate console.
```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```


### Start the project locally
```
npm run start
```

Note: If not already setup, you will also need to change the network so that it is pointing to localhost:7545 instead of pointing to the test or main nets.

Note: Open project in you favourite editor, e.g. sublime text:
```
.subl
```


### Testing
The tests are covering the solidity smart contract and are located at ./test. The purpose of those tests is to check the proper smart contract functionality of depositing, withdrawing amounts, as well as claiming an income within a certain time period. To run the tests, simply run:
```
truffle test
```
There are 5 tests for the UBI.sol contract.

Note: ganache-cli will need to be running in order for the tests to run
